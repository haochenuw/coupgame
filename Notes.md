Many randome failures

- `io.sockets.adapter.rooms[roomName]` lookup fails although the console log shows that it exists? 

- Typescript does not show types when hovered (only shows `any`). But in another project (multiplayer-snake) it shows, where it's not even using ts. 

TODO: 

- Show player who is who 

- Disable action when it's not their turn. 

- Coup action and Game over logic
